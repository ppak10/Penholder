Makes it easier to align and charge Apple iPhones wirelessly.

Even though wireless charging is not as efficient as a wired connection, it's convenient.

It also reduces wear and tear on the Apple lightning ports or future USB-C ports and
thus allows you to use the ports when you really need them to function i.e. for transporting large files (videos, pictures, etc) to a PC really fast.
